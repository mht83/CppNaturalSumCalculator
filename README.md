# SumOfMultiples

## Overview
The **SumOfMultiples** application is a simple yet powerful C++ program designed to calculate the sum of all natural numbers that are divisible by either 3 or 5, up to a limit specified by the user.

## How It Works
Upon execution, the program prompts the user to enter an integer that serves as the upper limit. It then iterates through all natural numbers up to this limit and accumulates the sum of numbers that are divisible by either 3 or 5.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `SumOfMultiples.cpp` file.
4. Compile the program using the following command:
g++ -o SumOfMultiples SumOfMultiples.cpp
5. Run the compiled executable:
./SumOfMultiples
## Sample Output
SumOfMultiples app enter an integer: 15 3 5 6 9 10 12 15 sum of all natural numbers divisible by either 3 or 5 up to your input is: 60
